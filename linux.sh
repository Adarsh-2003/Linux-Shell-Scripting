# ========== üìÇ FILE AND DIRECTORY OPERATIONS ==========

# Create files and directories

cd ~                    # The ~ is a shortcut for your home directory.
cd ~/project            # /home/project
touch example.txt       # Create empty file
mkdir test-dir
mkdir -p new-dir/subdir

# Write content to files
echo "this is file1" > file1

# Copy files and directories
cp file1.txt file1_copy.txt # Copy file
cp -r testdir testdir_copy # Copy directory and its contents
cp ~/.zshrc ~/Desktop/zshrc-copy # Copy hidden file
cp -r ~/Code ~/Desktop # Copy directory to Desktop

# Move and rename
mv file1.txt newname.txt # Rename file
mv newname.txt testdir/ # Move newname to testdir directory
mv testdir_copy new_testdir # Move testdir_copy directory to new_testdir directory
mv testdir/newname.txt ./original_file1.txt  # Move file to current directory
mv ~/Desktop/Code ~/Desktop/Code-move

# Remove files and directories
rm file2.txt
rm -i file3.txt # Interactive remove (ask before deleting)
rm -rf some_dir # Force remove directory and its contents (use mindefully)
rm -rf /        # Force remove everything ( wont work )
sudo rm -rf --no-preserve-root¬†/* # üíÄ iykyk
rmdir emptydir  # Only works if empty

# ========== üß≠ NAVIGATION ==========

pwd                                          # Show current directory
cd ~                                         # Go to home directory
cd /home/labex/project                       # Go to project directory
cd ..                                        # Go up one level
cd ~/Desktop && ls                           # Chain commands

# ========== üîç VIEW AND COMPARE FILES ==========

cat file.txt                                 # Show file content , -n for line numbers
head file.txt                                # First 10 lines
tail file.txt                                # Last 10 lines
diff file1 file2                             # Compare files
diff -r ~/Desktop ~/Code                     # Compare directories recursively

# ========== üîê FILE PERMISSIONS AND OWNERSHIP ==========

# Check file permissions
ls -l example.txt


# Permssions using numeric notation :

# 700 is a numeric representation of permissions:
# 7 - represents the owner's permissions.
# 0 - represents the group's permissions.
# 0 - represents the others' permissions.

# Each digit is a number from 0 to 7, calculated by adding the values 
# for read (4), write (2), and execute (1) permissions:

# So, 
# 7 (first digit) gives the owner read (4), write (2), and execute (1) permissions: 4+2+1=7
# 0 (second digit) gives the group no permissions (0+0+0=0).
# 0 (third digit) gives others no permissions (0+0+0=0).

# Therefore, 700 means: Owner: read, write, execute - Group: none - Others: none

# Change permissions (numeric)
chmod 700 example.txt                        # Owner full access, others none
chmod -R 755 ~/test-dir                      # Owner full access, group/others read+execute


# Permssions using symbolic notation :

u = user (owner)
g = group
o = others
a = all (user, group, others)
+ = add permission
- = remove permission

eg. u+x = add execute permission to user
eg. g-w = remove write permission from group
eg. ug+rwx = add read write and execute permission to user and group
eg. a+rw = add read and write permission to all

# Change permissions (symbolic)
chmod u+x script.sh                          # Add execute to owner
chmod g-w file.txt                           # Remove write from group
chmod o+r file.txt                           # Add read to others

# Change ownership
sudo chown user1:group1 target_file          # Change file owner & group
sudo chown root:root example.txt             # Set file to root ownership
sudo chown -R root:root new-dir              # Recursively change dir ownership
